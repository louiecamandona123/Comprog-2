      <p>Hello, fellas I'm RJ Soria, and today, I'm gonna show you what is computing, why, and how is it important?</p>
      <p>Computing is like having a super-smart friend who can do all sorts of things for you. They can help you with your work, your schoolwork, and even your hobbies. They can also help you connect with other people and learn new things.</p>

<p>Why are computers so important? Well, think about it this way: if you need to write a paper for school, your computer friend can help you research your topic, write the essay, and even check for mistakes. Or, if you're planning a trip, your computer friend can help you book flights, find a hotel, and even make dinner reservations.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Computers can do all sorts of cool stuff for us, from helping with work and school to making our lives easier and more fun. They're like having that super-smart friend who's always there for us, ready to help us out.</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for? Start exploring the world of computing today!</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-red">HTML</h1>
      <p>Imagine you're building a house. HTML is like the bricks and mortar that make up the structure of your website. It defines the different elements on your page, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Without HTML, your website would be a jumble of text and images, with no clear organization or structure.</p>
      <p>Think of it like this: if you want to write a letter to your friend, you need to use language to form sentences and paragraphs. Similarly, if you want to create a website, you need to use HTML to create the different elements that make up your page.</p>
      <p>HTML is a relatively easy language to learn, and there are many resources available online to help you get started. Once you have a basic understanding of HTML, you can start to create your own web pages and applications.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the key benefits of using HTML for front-end web development:</p>
      <p>* It's like the building blocks of your website.</p>
      <p>* It's easy to learn, even for beginners.</p>
      <p>* It's versatile and can be used to create a wide variety of web pages.</p>
      <p>* It's compatible with all major web browsers.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">CSS</h1>
      <p>Imagine you've built the structure of your website using HTML, but it's still bare-bones and unappealing. That's where CSS comes in. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is like the paint and decorations that give your website its personality and style. It allows you to control the layout, fonts, colors, and other visual aspects of your web pages.</p>
      <p>Think of it like this: if you've painted the walls of your room white, you can use CSS to add some color and personality. You can choose different colors for the text, buttons, and other elements on your page. You can also change the font, size, and weight of the text. And you can even add borders, shadows, and other effects to your elements</p>
      <p>CSS is a more complex language than HTML, but it's still relatively easy to learn. There are many resources available online to help you get started with CSS. Once you have a basic understanding of CSS, you can start to create beautiful and stylish web pages.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the key benefits of using CSS for front-end web development:</p>
      <p>* It lets you style your HTML elements to create a visually appealing website.</p>
      <p>* It's flexible and allows you to control every aspect of your website's appearance.</p>
      <p>* It can be used to create responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
      <p>* It's compatible with all major web browsers.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-orange">Javascript</h1>
      <p>Imagine you've built the structure and style of your website using HTML and CSS, but it's still static and unresponsive. That's where JavaScript comes in. JavaScript is like the lifeblood that brings your website to life. It allows you to create interactive elements, animations, and dynamic content.</p>
      <p>Think of it like this: if you've built a house with all the necessary rooms and furniture, JavaScript is like the electricity that powers the lights, switches on the appliances, and allows people to move around freely. It's the language that makes your website responsive to user interactions and allows you to create dynamic experiences.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is a more complex language than HTML or CSS, but it's still a very popular language for front-end web development. There are many resources available online to help you learn JavaScript. Once you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, you can start to create interactive and engaging websites.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the key benefits of using Javascript for front-end web development:</p>
      <p>* It brings your website to life by adding interactivity and dynamic content.</p>
      <p>* It allows you to create user-friendly elements like forms, buttons, and menus.</p>
      <p>* It enables you to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to control the content and structure of your page.</p>
      <p>* It supports asynchronous programming, allowing you to make requests to servers without blocking the user interface.</p>
